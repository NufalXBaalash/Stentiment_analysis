# 📊 Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on text data using traditional machine learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Random Forest**, with preprocessing and **TF-IDF** vectorization. It is ideal for classifying text as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

## 🧠 Code Overview

### 1. 📥 Loading Data

The notebook starts by loading training and testing CSV files.

```python
df_train = pd.read_csv("data/train.csv")
df_test = pd.read_csv("data/test.csv")
````

---

### 2. 🧹 Text Preprocessing

Steps include:

* Lowercasing
* Removing URLs, symbols, emojis
* Tokenizing and stemming
* Removing extra spaces

```python
def preprocessing(text):
    # Apply cleaning and tokenization steps
```

---

### 3. 🔠 Feature Extraction (TF-IDF)

Transform text data into numerical format using TF-IDF:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(df_train['preprocessed_text'])
X_test = vectorizer.transform(df_test['preprocessed_text'])
```

---

### 4. 🤖 Model Training

Implemented models:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### 5. 📊 Evaluation

Evaluation metrics include:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1
* Confusion Matrix

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

### 6. 📈 Feature Importance (TF-IDF)

Top 10 most important words plotted using `matplotlib`.

```python
# Sum TF-IDF scores and plot top words
```

---

## 🧪 Example Output

* ✅ **Accuracy**: \~85% (may vary)
* 💬 **Top Words**: "great", "bad", "love", "worst", etc.
* 📉 **Confusion Matrix** and word importance plots are saved in `/outputs/`.

---
